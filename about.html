        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
I have a strong interest in the geography of development, jihadism, religious terrorism, military strategy, international relations, and geopolitics. One of the most essential components of my research was the philosophy Hamas and its role in Middle East politics. Other important components of my research were postcolonialism and geography of health in local and global setting. I enjoy researching and contributing to topics pertaining to religious fanaticism, terrorism, the politics of jihad, military strategy and defensive strategy, as well as the geography of development. More than 70 people worldwide have cited my Ph.D., MA, and MSS theses, as well as additional research papers, journal articles, and conference papers.
As we understand it, time is linear—at least, the structural frame that guides our understanding of it is. Social science, and the science of history, like most other modern scientific disciplines, tends to be articulated in linear terms because of the nature of its logical arguments. Human behavior fluctuates sometimes radically and is affected by innumerable forces. The pursuit in understanding and predicting human behavior has faced changes, deconstruction, and developmental shifts since its conceptual birth, the scholars of the human sciences acting as pioneers in the effort. Such is the thrust of the famous dictum that those who do not learn from history are forced to repeat it. As we know, however, the perceived patterns of history are nothing more than human constructs imposed on an extraordinarily complex reality.
As the current conflict between the West and the Islamic worlds continues to escalate, many, particularly in the West, are tempted to question the general moral legitimacy of Islam as a religion. This is often based on vague and perfunctory interpretation of the Qur’an, in which several verses appear to endorse fighting— more specifically Jihad (or, Jihadism), to propagate Islam and expand the sphere of its domain.
The purpose of my research is to conduct a close analysis of the term Jihad in the Qur’an, examining its root cause and its use as a multi-faceted tool by Islamic populations over the period. Having established the theoretical framework of the issue, we demonstrate the historical experience of Jihadism in both forms of aggressive and peaceful through its travel across different cultural and political paradigms. In our case study, we also demonstrate the modern-day state use of this Qur’anic concept in both arenas of day-to-day civilian life, to the foreign policy postulation of Hamas. By highlighting the multi-facet character of Jihadism, we aim to clear up some misunderstandings and eradicate confusion about Jihadism.
